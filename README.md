# ollama-Reply

> **Disclaimer**: While I generally do not advocate for the use of automated tools for social media interactions, as they can sometimes detract from genuine human engagement, I wanted to build ollama-reply as an experiment. It was an opportunity to explore the capabilities of Ollama and dive into browser extensions.

Ollama-Reply is an open-source Chrome extension that leverages the power of the Ollama Llama3 model to generate smart, engaging replies for social media growth. This tool is designed as a free and open alternative to [MagicReply](https://magicreply.io/).

## Features

- **Open Source** üìñ: Freely modify and distribute the code.
- **Powerful AI** üß†: Uses the Ollama Llama3 model for generating replies.
- **Browser Extension** üåê: Easy to use directly in your chromium browser.
- **Customizable** ‚öôÔ∏è: Configurable to use any ollama model and adapt the answers to your needs
- **Free** üí∏: No cost to download and use the extension.

## Getting Started

### Installation Steps

1. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Ensure you set the environment variable `OLLAMA_ALLOW_ORIGINS=*` to allow calls from the browser extension.
